# RumiCar
The program and the computer language used will vary depending on the type of computer module; please be sure to use the corresponding programming language. If you use Arduino Nano or ESP32, please go to the "ArduinoAndESP32" folder. If you use Raspberry Pi Zero W, please go to the "RasPi" folder (RasPi uses Python).

### About folders

- **ArduinoAndESP32 folder**<br>This folder includes sample programs for RumiCar's Arduino Nano CM and ESP32 versions, for use at hands-on events. Presentation slides for such events are in the folder named **ハンズオン用テキスト(Material for hands-on)**.

  - **Exercise-1 Measuring distance**<br>RumiCar has three laser distance measurement modules on the front. Laser distance measurement modules determine distance by time of flight (ToF), which emits harmless lasers towards objects to calculate the  ***time*** between the laser's emission and return. The speed of sound is also called Mach, which is a unit of 1234.8 km/h (761.2 mph). Meanwhile, the speed of light is 880,000 times as fast as the speed of sound; it is an incredible thing, one must say, that such high speeds can be recorded.
  
    - **Exercise-1.1 Using the Central Sensor**<br>This exercise detects distance with the central unit of the three laser distance measurement modules on RumiCar. By using Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor, the measured values will be displayed on your computer in real time. If you move your hand back and forth in front of the sensor, the distance between your hand and the sensor changes, and so should the values displayed on the monitor.
    - **Exercise-1.2 Measure by three sensors**<br>In this exercise, all three sensors on RumiCar are used. Sensor values of distance gotten from left, center, and right one are displayed on Serial Monitor in real time.
    - **Exercise-1.3 Serial Plotter**<br>Arduino IDE has Serial Plottor, which generates a graph from sensor values. The program is the same as Exercise-1.2. Each line which indicates each sensor's values is indicated by different color and plotted into graph. Place your hand in from of sensors like you did in Exercise-1.2, and see how it works. Make sure which color shows which sensor valuses. There is no specific program in this exercise because you will use Exercise-1.2.
  - **Exercise-2 Motor control**<br>RumiCar uses motors when turning and driving. A computer inside CM on RumiCar turns the steering and spins motors by following a program. Let's control RumiCar's motors by using a CM.
    - **Exercise-2.1 Turn the steering**<br>In this exercise, RumiCar turns the steering right and left for 0.5 seconds, and it repeats the action. In other words, RumiCar repeats turning to left for 0.5 seconds and to right for 0.5 seconds.
    - **Exercise-2.2 Speed control**<br>In this exercise, RumiCar controls driving speed. Commands from a CM spin a driving motor which spins a back wheel motor. By changing rational sped of a tire, RumiCar changes driving speed. This program controls rational speed of the tire step by step. You will notice that sound is changed by changing rational speed of the motor.
    - **Exercise-2.3 Drive forward and reverse**<br>As a public car drives forward and reverse, so does RumiCar in this exercise. If there is not enough space for driving RumiCar, grab RumiCar by your hand and see how RumiCar's motor driving forward and reverse.
    - **Exercise-2.4 Zigzag drive**<br>In this exercise, RumiCar drives zigzag while driving forward. If there is not enough space for driving RumiCar, grab RumiCar by your hand and see RumiCar drives zigzag.
  - **Exercise-3 Basic of autonomous driving**<br>In this Exercise 3 which is basic of autonomous driving, you will control RumiCar based on sensor values. When RumiCar detects distance among objects in front of RumiCar or walls on the right or left, it stops or turns the steering to right or left.
    - **Exercise-3.1 Safety stop**<br>In this exercise, you will think about a vehicle which stops safely when it finds an obstacle on the front. RumiCar drives straight, and if there is no more obstacles in front, RumiCar will drive again. When an obstacle abroaches RumiCar, it drives reverse for safety. Suppose your hand is an obstacle and place it in front of RumiCar, make sure RumiCar stops without collision. Does RumiCar drive reverse when your hand approach RumiCar while it stops?
    - **Exercise-3.2 A vehicle which drives in a town**<br>In this exercise, RumiCar will drive in a test course. RumiCar dirves by detecting walls on sides and obstacles in front of RumiCar.
- **ESP32 folder**<br>ESP has wireless interference, such as WiFi and Bluetooth. Therefore, an ESP CM, which is one of the RumiCar CMs, has WiFi and Bluetooth. In this folder, there are sample programs to receive sensor values from RumiCar via ESP32's Bluetooth and wirelessly control RumiCar.
    - **BLE folder**<BR>BLE stands for Bluetooth Low Energy. Let's have a smartphone (iPhone) telecommunicate with BLE inside a RumiCar ESP32 CM. Sensor values from three laser distance measurement modules are displayed on BLE Scanner, which is an iPhone's app. BLE can do multiple connection; in other words, there is no need to disconnect other devices. Therefore, multiple devices can connect with one RumiCar at the same time. At an exhibition, you can plan a performance; for instance, visitors install a BLE Scanner app and see sensor values on their smart phone.
    - **Bluetooth folder**<br>Exercise-1.2 is a sample program for ESP32 CM's Bluetooth serial communication. This enables RumiCar to connect with a computer installed Windows and Bluetooth, display sensor values on a computer from laser distance measurement modules, and control RumiCar by sending commands from a computer.
      - Pairing Windos10
      - Settings ->Device ->Bluetooth and other devices->Bluetooth or add other devices ->Bluetooth
      - Select RumiCar_ESP32
      - Device manager ->On Port(COM & LPT), check "Standard Serial over Bluetooth link (COM #)" # is a number.　(There are two numbers.)
      - On setting on Arduino IDE, tool ->On Serial ports, select COM # which you saw at device manager
      - Now sensor values are displayed even though ESP32 is not connected by physical cables.
      - You can control RumiCar by sending commands from your computer.
      - The sample program has commands, "r", "l", "f", and "b". Each command conducts right, left, forward, and reverse, for 0.5 seconds. All comands are small letters. Send commands via serial monitor in Arduino IDE.
      - There is no need to connect by cables, so it is possible to recieve sensor values while RumiCar is driving or operate RumiCar like radio controlled cars by commands from a computer.
