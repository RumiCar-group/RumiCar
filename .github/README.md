## Workflows

The github workflows allow to automate multiple procedures of repository maintenance.

### Release Workflow
(It)[workflows/release.yaml] is used to check and prepare the RumiCar library for release.

The release allows to synchronize library version and the code it was built on, in contrast to keeping zip file inside the repository which could be out of date if the file was not updated.
